This lesson will get you up to speed on the aspects of using Supercomputing Wales that you need to participate in the DataAid challenge.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson assumes some familiarity with the Unix shell. If your shell is rusty, you may want to skim through the Software Carpentry [Introduction to the Unix shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice).
>
> There is an underlying assumption that you will be using Python to work on the activities in the DataAid challenge. There is no reason you can't use something else, but some of the material will be redundant, and you may need some additional information not covered here. Talk to one of the RSE team if you would like to use something other than Python (for example, Julia, R, C++, ...).
