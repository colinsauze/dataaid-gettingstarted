title: Setup

## Software
For this event, you will need to have a Bash shell with an SSH client installed, and a web browser.

To set up the Bash shell, please follow the instructions at [the Carpentries workshop template](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template#shell).

macOS and Git Bash on Windows come with SSH built in. Some Linux distributions may not include SSH; in this case, search your package manager for `openssh-client` (or `openssh-clients`).

## Supercomputing Wales

To make use of Supercomputing Wales facilities you need to have a Supercomputing Wales account approved, and you need to be a member of a project. These things take a little time to process, so please make sure you follow the instructions below in advance of the lesson:

* Log in to [the My Supercomputing Wales service](https://my.supercomputing.wales) with your credentials for one of the four partner institutions.
  * If you do not have a user account at any of the four listed universities, then please contact one of the organisers of the event.
* Depending on your institution, there may be a delay before your account is approved. Once your account is approved, then in the "Join a project" box at the upper right of the MySCW dashboard, request to join project `scw1738`.
